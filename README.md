Mental Health Support Chatbot (Forward & Backward Chaining)
This is a Streamlit application designed to demonstrate both Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining within a mental health support chatbot.

The application starts by using forward chaining to infer new facts from initial user inputs. It then uses backward chaining to work backward from a goal (a specific recommendation) to see if the gathered facts support it.
